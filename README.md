# Todo List Website

## Description
Final project for CSCI 4131: Internet Programming Fall 2024. This project aims to demonstrate our studies of the core languages and technologies of internet programming: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, the DOM, the HTTP protocol, and the standard back-end technologies used to build modern-day websites: routing, templatting, and SQL databases. 
### Disclaimer 
This course is not currently active, thus, the MySQL database connection will not work. The contents that would establish the database can be seen within the "schema.sql" file. 

## Requirements 
The project revolves around a primitive "to-do list" website. The requirements are broken down into four sections: 
### Technical Requirements 
- Must use the Express framework for the server.
- The server must run on the CSELabs machines.
- The website must store data persistently in your allocated MySQL database.
  - The queries to create your database will be stored in a file called "schema.sql"
- Good file structure is important and should "make sense".
### Visual Requirements 
- We are given freedom to the layout of our website; however, visible effort must be made to the visual appearance (i.e, must not be black-and-white).
- Screen size is not formally enforced; however, it should be documented if the website was developed on a less common screen size.
### Minimum Required Behaviors 
- The user should be able to view a to-do list containing items.
  - There should be a way to view all items that have not been deleted.
  - To-do items should be filterable. At a minimum, you should be able to view all "done" and "not done" items.
  - To-do list items can be created.
  - To-do list items can be deleted.
  - To-do list items can be marked as "done" and "undone". This is different than simply deleting an item.
